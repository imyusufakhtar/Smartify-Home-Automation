# Smartify-Home-Automation

- Smartify - Home Automation is an Android app that automates the control of devices in a home:
    - Smartify is a home automation project that aims to automate the control of various devices in a home using an Android app. The app allows users to control their devices easily, even from a remote location. Users can turn on/off lights, fans, and other appliances using the app.

- The project uses Firebase as the backend service to store data and communicate between the app and NodeMCU microcontroller:
     - Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform that provides a real-time database and backend as a service. The Smartify project uses Firebase to store the user data, device configurations, and communication logs. Firebase provides a reliable and scalable backend for the app, allowing for efficient communication between the app and the NodeMCU microcontroller.

- NodeMCU is a microcontroller that uses the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip to connect devices to the internet and control them:
     - NodeMCU is an open-source electronics platform that uses the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip to connect devices to the internet and control them. The ESP8266 chip is a low-cost Wi-Fi module that can be used for internet of things (IoT) projects. The NodeMCU microcontroller is programmed using the Arduino IDE and is used to control devices such as lights, fans, and other appliances in the home.

- The Android app sends commands to the NodeMCU to control devices such as lights, fans, and other appliances in the home:
    - The Android app communicates with the NodeMCU microcontroller via Wi-Fi to send commands to the connected devices. The app has a user-friendly interface that allows users to control their devices easily. Users can turn on/off lights, fans, and other appliances using the app. The app also allows users to create schedules and timers for their devices, which can be customized based on the user's preference.

- The app also allows users to create schedules, timers, and monitor the energy consumption of their devices:
    _ The Smartify app allows users to create schedules and timers for their devices, which can be customized based on the user's preference. This allows users to automate their devices based on a specific schedule. The app also allows users to monitor the energy consumption of their devices and control them to save energy. Users can track the energy consumption of their devices over time and make adjustments to their usage to save on their energy bill.

- Developed a Dashboard for monitoring and control: A dashboard was developed to give the user a real-time view of the status of the devices and the ability to control them. Additionally, the app also have feature of monitoring the energy consumption of the devices, giving user insight about the usage and help them in controlling the energy consumption.
